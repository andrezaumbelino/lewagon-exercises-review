### 🚀 Welcome to the Machine Learning Reboot Challenge! 🚀

This notebook is designed to be a refresher on a lot of the core concepts you've picked up so far in the Machine Learning module.

You'll go over the following topics:

**🧹 Data Cleaning 🧹**
<br>Practice using Pandas and scikit-learn transformers thoroughly to clean and pre-process the Airbnb dataset.

**🚦 Train-Test Split 🚦**
<br>Go over the methodology for splitting up our data correctly.

**👷 Pipelines 👷**
<br>Bring all your preprocessing and modelling steps together in a reusable pipeline.

**📈 Linear Regression 📈**
<br>Explore the fundamentals of linear regression and use it to make predictions on the Airbnb data.

**🔁 Cross-Validation 🔁**
<br>Revise cross-validation for estimating model performance.

**🎯 Fine-Tuning 🎯**
<br>Revise fine-tuning to optimize our model.
<br>
