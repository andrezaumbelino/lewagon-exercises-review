### Finalize your analysis

Continue working on the previous unit's `ceo-request.ipynb` notebook as needed.

🚀 Feel free to copy paste into your existing `seller.py` and `product.py` the updated contents from the `seller_updated_solution.py` and `product_updated_solution.py` inside the previous recap's solution. They contain `profits_per_seller` and `profits_per_product`.

### Present your analysis

You have 5 minutes per person (Q&A included) to convince the Olist CEO of your recommendations.

- We will create one group of students per Teacher/TA.
- Each one of you will present your analysis in front of your group.
- The TA will play the role of the CEO.

### Create jupyter notebook slides!

You will have to make a slide-based presentation using Jupyter Notebook **nbconvert**.

👉 Follow the `slide_like_a_pro.ipynb` guide to learn how to make them.

🏁 Stop your analyses 2 hours before the presentation so you have time to polish your presentation and speech.
